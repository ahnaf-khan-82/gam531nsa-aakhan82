#Assignment 2 Vector & Matrix Operations
##Overview

This project demonstrates basic vector and matrix operations using OpenTK in C#. It covers fundamental 3D math operations, including vector addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and basic 4x4 matrix transformations (identity, scaling, rotation).

Library Used:
OpenTK.Mathematics â€“ for Vector3, Vector4, Matrix4, and math helper functions.

##Implemented Operations:
Vector Operations

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Dot product (Vector3.Dot)

Cross product (Vector3.Cross)

Matrix Operations

Identity matrix (Matrix4.Identity)

Scaling (Matrix4.CreateScale)

Rotation around Y-axis (Matrix4.CreateRotationY)

Applying a matrix to a vector (Vector3.TransformPosition)
